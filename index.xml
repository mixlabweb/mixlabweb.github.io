Traditionally, KGs have been constructed through expensive human crowdsourcing efforts (such as WordNet, ConceptNet, and ATOMIC). Researchers have also explored the use of text mining techniques for automatic KG construction, but this remains a challenging task due to large corpus and complex processing required.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://mixlabweb.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mixlabweb.github.io/about/</guid><description>TBD</description></item></channel></rss>
